# ![Base16](logo.png)

An architecture for building themes based on carefully chosen syntax highlighting using a base of sixteen colors. Base16 provides a set of guidelines detailing how to style syntax and how to code a _builder_ for compiling Base16 _schemes_ and _templates_.

## Documentation

* [Styling Guidelines](https://github.com/base16-project/base16/blob/master/styling.md)
* [Builder Guidelines](https://github.com/base16-project/base16/blob/master/builder.md)
* [File Guidelines](https://github.com/base16-project/base16/blob/master/file.md)

## Template Repositories

To add your own template, submit a pull request to https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-templates-source and add your repository to the list below. **Repository naming scheme: base16-[template-name]** (with dashes as separators).

### Official Templates

As a part of the Base16 Project, we maintain a number of templates. Each has
been sponsored by at least one base16 project member who is committed to
maintaining that template.

We are open to accepting new projects, though they must still be sponsored by a
base16 project member and have some level of activity.

* [Emacs](https://github.com/base16-project/base16-emacs) maintained by [belak](https://github.com/belak)
* [FZF](https://github.com/base16-project/base16-fzf) maintained by [fnune](https://github.com/fnune)
* [Shell](https://github.com/base16-project/base16-shell) maintained by [belak](https://github.com/belak), [fnune](https://github.com/fnune), and [JamyGolden](https://github.com/JamyGolden)

### Contrib Templates

In order to prevent ownership issues, we're introducing the concept of contrib
templates. These are templates which have been handed over to the
base16-project, but either aren't sponsored by a base16-project member or don't
have enough usage to warrent including with our official templates.

Submitting a repository to [base16-project-contrib](https://github.com/base16-project-contrib)
and continuing to work on it is a great way to get involved and get noticed as a
maintainer so you can work towards getting added to the base16-project team.

### Unofficial Templates

If you have a template you maintain, but don't want to submit it to the contrib
repositories, feel free to add a link to the repository here to add it to this
list. These are community maintained templates and may not be updated often.

## Schemes

To add your own scheme, submit a pull request to the [base16-schemes repo](https://github.com/base16-project/base16-schemes) and add your scheme.

## Builders

Normally end-users should not need to use builders, as they're primarily meant
for maintainers - both scheme and template maintainers. These are tools used to
build templates with all the currently submitted schemes.

### Official Builder Repositories

Similar to our split between official and unofficial templates, we also have a
similar split for builders. Spec changes will not be merged until there is
consensus among maintainers and at least one builder with a pull request ready
for implementing that spec version.

* [Base 16 Builder Go](https://github.com/base16-project/base16-builder-go) maintained by [belak](https://github.com/belak) - currently supports 0.10.0
* [Base16 Builder Node](https://github.com/base16-project/base16-builder-node) maintained by [JoshGoebel](https://github.com/JoshGoebel) - currently supports 0.9.1

### Unofficial Builder Repositories

**Repository naming scheme: base16-builder-[language]** (with dashes as separators). The separate headings are the latest versions of the spec supported by each builder.
